    """
    Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) normalized by the infinity norm.
    
    Please pay attention to the inputs, it must have the following shape:
        (snapshots, nodes, variables).
        E.g. (200, 550, 3) would be 200 snapshots, of a graph of 550 nodes and 3 variables, such as position.
        E.g. (200, 550, 1) would be 200 snapshots, of a graph of 550 nodes and 1 variable, such as S.Mises.
        Eg (550, 3) would be taken care of automatically and transformed as (1, 550, 3)
        E.g. (200, 550) WON'T WORK, because it will interpretate the input as 550 variable vector.

    Args:
        data_ground_truth (numpy.ndarray): Ground truth data with shape (snapshot, nodes, variable).
                                           In case of (nodes, variable), it expands snapshot dim to 1.
        data_predicted (numpy.ndarray): Predicted data with the same shape as data_ground_truth.
                                        In case of (nodes, variable), it expands snapshot dim to 1.

    Returns:
        float: RMSE normalized by the infinity norm.
